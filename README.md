# Machine-Learning-Decision-Tree

##General info

we have a table with LM values and we have to classify them 
we classify them into 3 groups
* non-critical
* semi-critical
* critical

I have used Decision Tree Classifier to classify 
Because it provides visual support and it's very easy to understand.
